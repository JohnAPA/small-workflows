# Contributing to Small Workflows

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ‚ô•Ô∏è

You can:

- Submit [bug reports or feature requests](../../issues/new/choose)
- Fix [open issues](../../issues) and [create PRs](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
- Improve documentation, the code and more! These are just some ideas.

## Improving the workflows

If you wish that a workflow did something that it currently doesn't do or perhaps it does something wrong and you wish it was fixed, you can open an [issue](../../issues/new) saying what it is you want fixed or added. Alternatively, you can make the change yourself in the workflow, then export the workflow with something like [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) and I can take a look at it and add the changes. Or you can directly submit a PR [like this](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/pull/16).

If you are interested in making your own workflows, you can read [how to write Alfred workflows in Go](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/writing-alfred-workflows-in-go-2a44f62dc432).

Go workflows will have setup instructions similar to [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#dependencies).

Have fun! üöÄ

## Opening PRs

Please search [existing issues](../../issues/) and [pull requests](../../pulls/) to check if somebody else is already working on the issue.

Don't be afraid to ask questions, open issues for discussion or opening [Draft PRs](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) with code.
